[[Clarity is an equalizing force]]. Typically existing power structures and hierarchies are the ones that benefit for lack of clarity. If nobody knows what's going on or how decisions are made, those who already have power can continue operating as they wish. Thus it's no surprise that many of the biggest tech CEOs decry process as a innovation-killing and pace-slowing. If you have power, why would you want to introduce means by which it could be checked? Why would you want to transfer more power to the collective and away from yourself and those you choose? You wouldn't.\n\n\n## Why do we have these associations between centralization and control?\n\nWell, because it's undeniable that one often generates the other. \n\nCentralization creates conditions where humans tend to be exploited by a dominant personality exerting control.\n\nDecentralization has been offered as a political philosophy, via anarchism, for centuries, but recent technology has brought the idea into new realms and common parlance.\n\nThe thing is decentralization moves us away from centralization, which may or may not move us away from control. Decentralized systems are difficult to control, but not impossible, and while through the added difficulty they often break up control, they similarly are difficult to _cooperate_ within.\n\nThis is the most important measure of any human systems: the ability of human beings to cooperate within it.\n\nWhen we get rid of centralization, we often dismantle our coooperative connections. We need to be attacking _control_ not centralization. Centralized systems of cooperation are generally very beneficial for all involved. An example most tech workers can empathize with is the difficult in finding anything in Notion when teams splinter in 10s, 100s, or 1000s of separate databases. Lacking clear centralized processes actually _increases_ the leverage individuals have by providing a wider platform for their work, and enhanced opportunities for cooperation.\n\n## Analytics engineering is cooperative centralization\n\nAnalytics engineering is designed as a system of cooperative centralization. A collaborative knowledge graph in which the entire company works through sense-making activities to find meaning together. The warehouse need not be physically centralized, nor does a single repository of code need to represent an analytics engineering project, but there should be an emphasis on *meaning* remaining cooperative, and a light pressure towards effective centralization will lend itself to that, versus an opposite push to decentralize as much as possible. A single source of truth is always the goal of analytics engineering, even if that source is a variety of projects and tools. It's up to those who build dbt to create the cooperative, centralized experience of a single source of truth across disparate, heterogenous tools and platforms.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-06T00:09:14.383885707Z","tags":null},"/notes/Clarity-is-an-equalizing-force":{"title":"Clarity is an equalizing force","content":"\nThe people who benefit from lack of clarity are those already in power.

For example, proposals go in a certain Notion database, they use a specific template, they require certain metadata. Structure is used to create _clarity_, which empowers independent action. When you've got clarity you can move faster.\n\n_Process_ is **_layers_** of structure. It involves gatekeeping to move from one layer to the next. It's used in an attempt to control outcomes and make work more repeatable (or more likely, repetitive). Control slows things down. You can put a restricter on an engine to ensure it doesn't exceed 30 mph. The consequence is you won't go more than 30 mph.\n\nPeople in tech _very_ often confuse these two concepts as one thing. As a company grows they sense things slowly down, and reach for every CEO's favorite scapegoat: process. In fear of creating process, they refuse to own their responsibility to create structure.\n\nUnfortunately, both of these things are necessary for organized action. We want to maximize structure and minimize process, but we need some of both. The consequence of the chaos that ensues from lacking both is that every team creates their own structure and process out of necessity. Now not only do you have too much process, you have too _many_.\n\nTech leaders need to spend more time creating unified structure and norms, and understand that's not the same thing as process.

Could always be rounded into discrete though.\n\n## Explain the difference between reliability and validity\n\n- **Reliability** measures how precise our measurement is. Are we measuring with a fine enough grain to be useful? How repeatable and consistent are the results? Our instruments or experimental designs need to be reliable to give us precise measurements.\n- **Validity** measures how accurate we are, is the measurement useful in its correspondence to reality.\n- Unreliable measurements can make it hard to determine which, if any, of the same measurements of something are valid or accurate, so some people say **reliability is a necessity for validity**.\n\u003c!--ID: 1672978686740--\u003e\n\n\n## What are the 4 main types of reliability?\n\n1. **Test-retest reliability** - does repeating the test over time yield the same results\n2. **Inter-rater reliability** - if different experimenters (people) run the test do they get the same results\n3. **Parallel forms reliability** - do different versions of the same instrument (like a variety of bathroom scales to measure your weight) yield the same result\n4. **Internal consistency reliability** - do the individual parts of a combined result yield consistent answers\n\u003c!--ID: 1672978686742--\u003e\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-06T00:09:14.383885707Z","tags":null}}
