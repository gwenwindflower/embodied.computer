[[Clarity is an equalizing force]]. Typically existing power structures and hierarchies are the ones that benefit for lack of clarity. If nobody knows what's going on or how decisions are made, those who already have power can continue operating as they wish. Thus it's no surprise that many of the biggest tech CEOs decry process as a innovation-killing and pace-slowing. If you have power, why would you want to introduce means by which it could be checked? Why would you want to transfer more power to the collective and away from yourself and those you choose? You wouldn't.\n\n\n## Why do we have these associations between centralization and control?\n\nWell, because it's undeniable that one often generates the other. \n\nCentralization creates conditions where humans tend to be exploited by a dominant personality exerting control.\n\nDecentralization has been offered as a political philosophy, via anarchism, for centuries, but recent technology has brought the idea into new realms and common parlance.\n\nThe thing is decentralization moves us away from centralization, which may or may not move us away from control. Decentralized systems are difficult to control, but not impossible, and while through the added difficulty they often break up control, they similarly are difficult to _cooperate_ within.\n\nThis is the most important measure of any human systems: the ability of human beings to cooperate within it.\n\nWhen we get rid of centralization, we often dismantle our coooperative connections. We need to be attacking _control_ not centralization. Centralized systems of cooperation are generally very beneficial for all involved. An example most tech workers can empathize with is the difficult in finding anything in Notion when teams splinter in 10s, 100s, or 1000s of separate databases. Lacking clear centralized processes actually _increases_ the leverage individuals have by providing a wider platform for their work, and enhanced opportunities for cooperation.\n\n## Analytics engineering is cooperative centralization\n\nAnalytics engineering is designed as a system of cooperative centralization. A collaborative knowledge graph in which the entire company works through sense-making activities to find meaning together. The warehouse need not be physically centralized, nor does a single repository of code need to represent an analytics engineering project, but there should be an emphasis on *meaning* remaining cooperative, and a light pressure towards effective centralization will lend itself to that, versus an opposite push to decentralize as much as possible. A single source of truth is always the goal of analytics engineering, even if that source is a variety of projects and tools. It's up to those who build dbt to create the cooperative, centralized experience of a single source of truth across disparate, heterogenous tools and platforms.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-06T21:58:13.784365613Z","tags":null},"/notes/Clarity-is-an-equalizing-force":{"title":"Clarity is an equalizing force","content":"\nThe people who benefit from lack of clarity are those already in power.

Unlike computers, humans do not have the ability to find patterns in large quantities of raw data.\n\nWe need tools and processes by which we can do that, and collectively those tools and processses are called 'data modeling'.\n\nWhile writing SQL to transform the data (in a ELT or ETL paradigm) is the aspect of data modeling that is typically focused on, it's only one part of the process. Gathering requirements, developing contracts, and building semantic represenations of the objects you transform the data into are crucial parts of the process as well.\n\nLet's focus on building semantic represenations of our transformed objects.\n\nTo infuse purpose into our data transformations, we need to craft surfaces for people to interact with and animate the stories within. In practical terms, this looks like connecting models to dashboards, notebooks, and ML in flexible and accurate ways. Metrics, exposures, bringing usage nodes into our concept of the DAG -- these are all methods by which we can build these semantic surfaces for people to explore.\n\nAt present, this work is often treated as a post-step to data modeling, when in fact, as [Josh Devlin points out](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/josh-devlin_datamodeling-datamodelling-activity-7038354656720277504-bfjn?utm_source=share\u0026utm_medium=member_desktop), they're crucial and integrated parts of the modeling process. Without these steps, we're writing a book without publishing it.\n\nThe good news is, increasingly, dbt provides robust tooling for this part of the modeling process. The semantic layer and data contracts are becoming easier to build directly from within dbt, yielding powerful integrative effects with the transformation work happening on the physical layer.\n\nOur models (in the expansive sense described above), need to be in evolving conversation with those acting on the narratives they generate. If we consider building our static objects via SQL models to be the end of our model lifecycle, we're missing out on some of the most vibrant opportunties for collaboration, impact, and collective sense-making.\n\nThe collaborative and collective aspects of the data modeling process are essential. Unlike writing a novel, storytelling in data modeling is [tasked with finding useful narratives that move us towards our goals](https://www.gwenwindflower.com/blog/1). and functions collaboratively. We respond and refine based on how our readers bring these stories into their day-to-day lives. We can emphasize certain locations, write more about certain characters, or correct where we've accidentally deviated from what happened. As the semantic layer expands, this kind of feedback loop will increasingly be implemented in that flexible and actionable layer, making this step of data modeling even more important.\n\ndbt is the best data modeling tool presently available, and it's crucial that it continues to expand its feature set to encompass the entire lifecycle of data modeling in an integrated way. dbt should be a a tool for crafting meaningful narrative through every phase of data modeling from raw data to collaborators acting on the stories that are uncovered.","lastmodified":"2023-03-06T21:58:13.784365613Z","tags":null},"/notes/Effective-maps-get-you-where-you-want-to-go":{"title":"Effective maps","content":"\nYou can't measure the effectiveness of a map based on its resolution or how well it was constructed.

For example, proposals go in a certain Notion database, they use a specific template, they require certain metadata. Structure is used to create _clarity_, which empowers independent action. When you've got clarity you can move faster.\n\n_Process_ is **_layers_** of structure. It involves gatekeeping to move from one layer to the next. It's used in an attempt to control outcomes and make work more repeatable (or more likely, repetitive). Control slows things down. You can put a restricter on an engine to ensure it doesn't exceed 30 mph. The consequence is you won't go more than 30 mph.\n\nPeople in tech _very_ often confuse these two concepts as one thing.

In fear of creating process, they refuse to own their responsibility to create structure.\n\nUnfortunately, both of these things are necessary for organized action.

There is a voice inside that is constantly judging, first ourselves and then others. That voice enjoys the indulgence of an endless negative critique. Because we have learned to believe negativity is more realistic, it appears more real than any positive voice. Once we begin to replace negative thinking with positive thinking, it becomes utterly clear that, far from being realistic, negative thinking is absolutely disenabling.\n  When we are positive we not only accept and affirm ourselves, we are able to affirm and accept others.

When we feel deeply drawn to someone, we cathect with them; that is, we invest feelings or emotion in them. That process of investment wherein a loved one becomes important to us is called \"cathexis.\" In his book Peck rightly emphasizes that most of us \"confuse cathecting with loving.\"\n- he defines love as \"the will to extend one's self for the purpose of nurturing one's own or another's spiritual growth.\"\n    - Tags: [[favorite]] \n- \"Love is as love does. Love is an act of will — namely, both an intention and an action. Will also implies choice.\n  We do not have to love.

But he was starting to perceive that gender was a way of seeing the world, too. Military bots, especially ones with armored bodies like Paladin’s, were almost always called “he.” People assigned genders based on behaviors and work roles, often ignoring anatomy. Gender was a form of social recognition. That’s why humans had given him a gender before he even had a name.

Not having willpower, but not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success. This is where the organisation of writing and note-taking comes into play.

If you make a plan, you impose a structure on yourself; it makes you inflexible. To keep going according to plan, you have to push yourself and employ willpower.

It smelled like sugar and charred meat. You could get a foot massage. You could get your name whittled into a piece of jade to use as a signature stamp. You could eat dumplings, candied crab apples, raw sugarcane, stir-fries, whole crabs, whole grilled squids on a stick.\n  The nostalgia of it hit me all at once. I couldn't think straight.\n  As a kid, I used to eat sugarcane, the juicy fibers unsplit from the cane casing.\n  Across the street, a 7-Eleven magically miraged in front of me, a beacon of American summer, and I ducked inside for reprieve.\n  In its cooling, life-affirming fluorescence, I paced up and down the tidy aisles, stocked with American products in Asian flavors.\n  Squid-flavored potato chips.

And yet, people cannot live in nature without changing it. But this is true of all creatures; they depend upon nature, and they change it.

Because of the woodpeckers, nature is different from what it would be without them. It is different also because of the borers and ants that live in tree trunks, and because of the bacteria that live in the soil under the trees.
