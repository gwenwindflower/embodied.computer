For example, proposals go in a certain Notion database, they use a specific template, they require certain metadata. Structure is used to create _clarity_, which empowers independent action. When you've got clarity you can move faster.\n\n_Process_ is **_layers_** of structure. It involves gatekeeping to move from one layer to the next. It's used in an attempt to control outcomes and make work more repeatable (or more likely, repetitive). Control slows things down. You can put a restricter on an engine to ensure it doesn't exceed 30 mph. The consequence is you won't go more than 30 mph.\n\nPeople in tech _very_ often confuse these two concepts as one thing. As a company grows they sense things slowly down, and reach for every CEO's favorite scapegoat: process. In fear of creating process, they refuse to own their responsibility to create structure.\n\nUnfortunately, both of these things are necessary for organized action. We want to maximize structure and minimize process, but we need some of both. The consequence of the chaos that ensues from lacking both is that every team creates their own structure and process out of necessity. Now not only do you have too much process, you have too _many_.\n\nTech leaders need to spend more time creating unified structure and norms, and understand that's not the same thing as process. Give people an organized way to work and understand the movement of the organization, but make it as flat as you can and don't require any more layers of approval than you have to.\n\nYour employees will thanks you, and the less power they wield in your organization, the more grateful they will be for the increase in leverage the a high structure, low process environment provides.\n\n[Note: you could flip these words if you wanted, or sub in some other terms, what's important is parsing out the separate concepts behind them that often get lumped together.]\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-02T19:49:24.532383147Z","tags":null},"/reading/Currently-reading":{"title":"Currently reading","content":"## Books that I'm currently reading\n```dataview\nTABLE\n\ttitle,\n\trating,\n\tauthor,\n\tstatus\nFROM \"reading/books\"\nWHERE status = \"Currently reading\"\nSORT rating DESC\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-02T19:49:24.532383147Z","tags":null},"/reading/Paused":{"title":"Paused","content":"## Books that I'm paused on\n```dataview\nTABLE \n\ttitle as \"Title\",\n\tgenre_1 as \"Genre 1\",\n\trating AS \"Rating\"\nFROM \"reading/books\"\nWHERE status = \"Paused\"\nSORT rating DESC\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-02T19:49:24.532383147Z","tags":null},"/reading/authors/Annalee-Newitz":{"title":"Annalee Newitz","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-03-02T19:49:24.532383147Z","tags":null},"/reading/authors/Carmen-Maria-Machado":{"title":"Carmen Maria Machado","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-03-02T19:49:24.532383147Z","tags":null},"/reading/authors/L.X.-Beckett":{"title":"L.X.

Are we measuring with a fine enough grain to be useful? How repeatable and consistent are the results? Our instruments or experimental designs need to be reliable to give us precise measurements.\n- **Validity** measures how accurate we are, is the measurement useful in its correspondence to reality.\n- Unreliable measurements can make it hard to determine which, if any, of the same measurements of something are valid or accurate, so some people say **reliability is a necessity for validity**.\n\u003c!--ID: 1672978686740--\u003e\n\n\n## What are the 4 main types of reliability?\n\n1. **Test-retest reliability** - does repeating the test over time yield the same results\n2. **Inter-rater reliability** - if different experimenters (people) run the test do they get the same results\n3. **Parallel forms reliability** - do different versions of the same instrument (like a variety of bathroom scales to measure your weight) yield the same result\n4. **Internal consistency reliability** - do the individual parts of a combined result yield consistent answers\n\u003c!--ID: 1672978686742--\u003e\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-02T19:49:24.532383147Z","tags":null}}
