## Testing
- test value
- **critical value** - is the value at which we say the test is statistically signifcant 
- **alpha** - what's the max value we're willing to accept of type 1 errors (0.05, 0.01)
- **p-value** - probability that something happened by chance. low p-value means unlikely to be chance difference between populations, and thus supports the alternative hypothesis. in more technical terms, it's the probability that you would you get a difference as extreme or more extreme than the one observed. if it's low, usually 0.05, that would indicate there's only a 5% probability that this difference happened by chance, and a 95% probabality that the result happened because of intervention. again this supports the alternative hypothesis.

## Confidence interval
- smaller the sample, larger the range
- larger the sample, smaller the range

## Statistical power

## Questions
- this makes no sense to me: "For CIs for proportions, it is typically assumed that the sample size is large enough to ensure that the normal approximation to the binomial distribution is valid."
- ANOVA and t-tests seem to do the same thing, when would you choose which?
- Similarly, if the variances of the different groups being compared are not equal, the test results may not be reliable. ?? equal how? when in the real world would you have equal variance?
- i have no idea how to read this ![[Screenshot 2023-02-05 at 21.19.44.png]]
