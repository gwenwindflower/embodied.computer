## Highlights
- I emerged onto the hot, humid street. It was a night market, a neon blur of stalls selling jade bracelets, scarves, fortune-telling services, massages, animals, assorted tchotchkes, crowded with locals and tourists. It smelled like sugar and charred meat. You could get a foot massage. You could get your name whittled into a piece of jade to use as a signature stamp. You could eat dumplings, candied crab apples, raw sugarcane, stir-fries, whole crabs, whole grilled squids on a stick.
  The nostalgia of it hit me all at once. I couldn't think straight.
  As a kid, I used to eat sugarcane, the juicy fibers unsplit from the cane casing.
  Across the street, a 7-Eleven magically miraged in front of me, a beacon of American summer, and I ducked inside for reprieve.
  In its cooling, life-affirming fluorescence, I paced up and down the tidy aisles, stocked with American products in Asian flavors.
  Squid-flavored potato chips. Cherry-blossom Kit Kats. From among the orderly rows of lychee juice cans and soy-milk cartons and neon aloe vera juice bottles with floating pulp, I selected a Pepsi.
  Thank you, come again, the cashier deadpanned in English. (PageÂ 102)
