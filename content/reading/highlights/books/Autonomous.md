- Everybody is an outsider, if you go deep enough. The trick is reassuring people that you’re their kind of outsider.” ([Location 2129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N4P14CI&location=2129))

- Paladin knew that human gender was part of sexual desire. But he was starting to perceive that gender was a way of seeing the world, too. Military bots, especially ones with armored bodies like Paladin’s, were almost always called “he.” People assigned genders based on behaviors and work roles, often ignoring anatomy. Gender was a form of social recognition. That’s why humans had given him a gender before he even had a name. ([Location 2587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N4P14CI&location=2587))
- Open data would be the gateway to a runaway synthetic biology apocalypse. But now we know there has been no one great disaster—only the slow-motion disaster of capitalism converting every living thing and idea into property.

- Nobody could find out what she was thinking, unless she allowed it. The key to autonomy, she realized, was more than root access on the programs that shaped her desires. It was a sense of privacy. ([Location 4277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N4P14CI&location=4277))
- research on the public net had led to massive text repositories about the history of transgender humans who had switched pronouns just the way she had. She was pretty sure that Eliasz anthropomorphized her as one of these humans, imagining she had been assigned the wrong pronoun at birth. Maybe he would never understand that his human categories—faggot, female, transgender—didn’t apply to bots. Or maybe he did understand. After all, he still loved her, even though her brain was gone. Because she could, Paladin kept her ideas about this to herself. They were the first private thoughts she’d ever had.
