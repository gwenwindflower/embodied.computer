## Highlights
- Having a meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower every time. Not having willpower, but not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success. This is where the organisation of writing and note-taking comes into play. ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=179))

    - Note: daily practice and flow — finding and *enjoying* a practice to weave through the day is the key
- A good structure enables flow, the state in which you get so completely immersed in your work that you lose track of time and can just keep on going as the work becomes effortless (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975). Something like that does not happen by chance. ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=195))

- Having a clear structure to work in is completely different from making plans about something. If you make a plan, you impose a structure on yourself; it makes you inflexible. To keep going according to plan, you have to push yourself and employ willpower. ([Location 201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=201))
- The challenge is to structure one’s workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward. We do not want to make ourselves dependent on a plan that is threatened by the unexpected, like a new idea, discovery – or insight.

- Even hard work can be fun as long as it is aligned with our intrinsic goals and we feel in control. The problems arise when we set up our work in such an inflexible way that we can’t adjust it when things change and become arrested in a process that seems to develop a life of its own.
