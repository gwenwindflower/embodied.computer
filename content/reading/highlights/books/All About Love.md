## Highlights
- Self-acceptance is hard for many of us. There is a voice inside that is constantly judging, first ourselves and then others. That voice enjoys the indulgence of an endless negative critique. Because we have learned to believe negativity is more realistic, it appears more real than any positive voice. Once we begin to replace negative thinking with positive thinking, it becomes utterly clear that, far from being realistic, negative thinking is absolutely disenabling.
  When we are positive we not only accept and affirm ourselves, we are able to affirm and accept others. (Page 56)
- If we succeed without confronting and changing shaky foundations of low self-esteem rooted in contempt and hatred, we will falter along the way. (Page 61)
- Creating domestic bliss is especially useful for individuals living alone who are just learning to be self-loving.
  When we intentionally strive to make our homes places where we are ready to give and receive love, every object we place there enhances our well-being. (Page 66)
- Much as I enjoy popular New Age commentary on love, I am often struck by the dangerous narcissism fostered by spiritual rhetoric that pays so much attention to individual self-improvement and so little to the practice of love within the context of community.
- Spiritual life is first and foremost about commitment to a way of thinking and behaving that honors principles of interbeing and interconnectedness.
- A commitment to spiritual life necessarily means we embrace the eternal principle that love is all, everything, our true destiny.
- Most of us learn early on to think of love as a feeling. When we feel deeply drawn to someone, we cathect with them; that is, we invest feelings or emotion in them. That process of investment wherein a loved one becomes important to us is called "cathexis." In his book Peck rightly emphasizes that most of us "confuse cathecting with loving."
- he defines love as "the will to extend one's self for the purpose of nurturing one's own or another's spiritual growth."

- "Love is as love does. Love is an act of will — namely, both an intention and an action. Will also implies choice.
  We do not have to love. We choose to love."
- When we understand love as the will to nurture our own and another's spiritual growth, it becomes clear that we cannot claim to love if we are hurtful and abusive. Love and abuse cannot coexist.
