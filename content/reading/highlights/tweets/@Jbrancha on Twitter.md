## Highlights
- Just as our brain turns our messy visual perception into coherent pictures, it also turns our messy thoughts into coherent understanding. As helpful as this is, it means we are not always understanding things as they are. As our brain fills in the gaps in our thinking, we struggle to see those gaps and address them.
  With writing we can expose the gaps in our thinking. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1482416545/18755884))
    - Note: experiment was done that asked people how simple everyday devices work, for instance, if they understand how a toilet works, people reply 'yes'. (i know i would)
      forced to explain or diagram how it works, they completely fall over (again, i definitely would). this is the same principle here!
