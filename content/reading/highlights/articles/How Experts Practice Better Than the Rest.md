## Highlights
- Deliberate practice is when you work on a skill that requires 1 to 3 practice sessions to master. If it takes longer than that, then you are working on something that is too complex.
  Once you master this tiny behavior, you can move on to practicing the next small task that will take 1 to 3 sessions to master. Repeat this process for 10,000 hours. That is deliberate practice. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1482370972/18754385))
    - Note: Related to the idea of having small goals and bounding process. Getting deep into process over outcomes is key, but there should be small goals bounding the process that let you check-in on where you're headed.
- Expertise is not a race that can be won. It is simply a process that can be embraced. Experts are constantly asking themselves, “What am I missing? What new information is out there? What can I learn? How can I grow?”
  Expertise is a process, not an outcome. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1482370972/18754400))
    - Note: Per previous note, this! Next steps, building, creating, and clear goals are key, but simply as guideposts to keep your process moving in the right direction. There is no true outcome or destination. Sisyphus strikes again, baby!
