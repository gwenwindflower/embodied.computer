## Highlights
- Search is great when you are looking through the internet, know what you’re looking for and need a good result. For example, a google search for “the height of Mt Everest” will give you exactly what you need. Search fails when you are looking through your knowledge base, might not know the exact query, and are looking for a highly specific result. For example, say you saved an article about government tax breaks. Searching those exact terms together might yield no results but searching for “government” or “tax” individually might flood your screen with non-relevant data.
- The reason keywords don’t work is because they require people to do something that the human brain is not good at - working with and remembering an unbounded number of things.
- Thinking about information in terms of trees reflects how humans naturally think about things and there is increasing evidence that the human brain is hard-wired to think in terms of hierarchies
- The reason we don't use trees to organize and find information today is that existing tools make it unfeasible to do so. The means of organizing information in a "modern" knowledge base is the same as it was fifty years ago - folders and tags.
- Ever since Google became the dominant way to find information on the web, knowledge bases gave up trying to improve on organization. Why organize when you can search? The problem is that search doesn't work in these tools and continues to get worse as the amount of information we track keeps growing.
