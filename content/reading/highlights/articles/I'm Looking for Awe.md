## Highlights
- One of my favorite little language rabbit holes is the origin of the word “glamor.” It comes to us from the Scottish “gramarye,” shifting the English word “grammar” to mean something close to “magic spell” or “enchantment.” This term lives by the French “grimoire,” which you may more immediately associate with rituals, witches, and the arcane. “Grammatica” once referred to learning in the broadest sense, back when education was strictly for the elite, and the people who held such knowledge might as well have been sorcerers. To this day, “glamor” speaks to that sense of astonishment, the sentiment that wells up when you lay eyes on the something that both befuddles and amazes you: the divine.
- This is all to say that in the moment when the sunset filtered gently into the library, and you noticed it, and it made you feel something spectacular and maybe a bit frightening in its grandeur, were you not, for all intents and purposes, in a church?

- Awe, glamor, and magic are all around us. We’ve barely scratched the surface of knowable things in this life. There is plenty to genuflect to, things both large and small. Look for wonder, and you will find it. And sometimes, as you well know, it finds you. Either way, when you come across it, I hope you approach it with curiosity and humility. That’s my religion, anyway.
