## Highlights
- all the tears i cried because i had all this love with “no one to give it to”. it didn’t occur to me that i was the source and that i should have also been the reciever.
- i want to dedicate this year to melting down the hard protective barriers i have made in compartmentalizing love, romance, friendship, intimacy and sex. what i thought impossible in my lonely teenage years feels like second nature to me now. love, in all of its many myriading forms, cannot be categorized nor even defined. it is constantly imagining and imagined, and there is so much more to learn.
