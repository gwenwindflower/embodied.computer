# My preferred translations of tanha and dukkha are fast-grabby-thing and evil-vibrating-blob

Makes it obvious what kind of thing to look for to see them. Translations like clinging & suffering make them sound like abstract ideas. They’re not, they’re fast subtle mental movements

## Highlights
- My preferred translations of tanha and dukkha are fast-grabby-thing and evil-vibrating-blob Makes it obvious what kind of thing to look for to see them. Translations like clinging & suffering make them sound like abstract ideas. They’re not, they’re fast subtle mental movements
- There’s not much to say about the evil vibrating blob other than that it’s evil — it’s the reason we think things are bad — and it’s vibrating asymmetrically, bc asymmetry lowers valence. It’s the mind’s evolved way of injecting suffering. It doesn’t really have other properties
- Tanha is a more complex, bc its a type of grabby thing (takes ~1/10th of a second) but it also changes how self feels. It turns thing into “my problem” But the main thing is to not confuse you into thinking it’s an abstract concept. Just look in experience for a grabby thing
- The fastness means you need a lot of sensory clarity and concentration to see them. That’s basically why concentration is a thing in meditation in the first place. It’s not for its own sake, it’s just a means to be able to see things like this bc they’re unfortunately quite fast
