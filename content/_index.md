These are the working notes of sentient embodied computer Gwyenth Olivia Windflower (a standard "TS-1 Elven" model).

Theres is no index or table of contents, they are networked and designed for emergent discovery and exploration.

They are created primarily during my [[notes/Morning pages|morning pages]] writing practice.

You may start wherever, but perhaps my collected thoughts on [[notes/Note-taking is an art practice| note taking as an art practice is a nice place to start]].
