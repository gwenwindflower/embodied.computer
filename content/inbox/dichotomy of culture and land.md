i love technology and culture, my very identity requires the apparatus of modern medicine to warp my physical body to suit my heart and soul. to be my most natural self and need profoundly unnatural technology. i love fashion. i love color. i love new sounds and images. 

how do i reconcile my reliance on the profoundly unnatural apparatus of modern medicine to create consonance between my soul and body with my yearning to live in harmony with nature? 

i have no fucking idea.
