Organizations are almost universally dysfunctional in managing collective knowledge (unsurprising considering we're individually pretty bad at it as well)

The reason individual struggles with knowledge management grow exponentially with increasing collaborators in the system is not _just_ typical system growth complexity, but also a unique division between people who enjoy building and maintaining the system and those who just want to use it or consume information.

- It's important to note that both of these roles are necessary and form a spectrum. Nobody is solely a maintainer or a pure consumer, but like extraversion and introversion they form poles and we all fall somewhere in-between.

- There is also a third property that can apply to anybody anywhere on this spectrum, which is the authority to approve and promote systems. Typically this rests with the leadership of a tech organization or team within it, though some organizations, particularly those with a long history of remote work and distributed teams, may have a specific role or team empowered with this authority. for example, a Head of Remote.

We can envision a healthier, friendlier, and more effective system if we think of the knowledge itself — not the artifacts or the systems, but the decisions and actions generated from collective understanding — as a meal at a great restaurant. Think the type of Brooklyn hole-in-the-wall that lowkey has a Michelin star and writes a weekly menu on pieces of looseleaf based on seasonal ingredients from local farms. Simple but elevated; comfy but profitable. you don't need to get dressed up, but the meal is going to cost what it should ($$$) — and it will be one of the best meals you have this year. That's what we're going for. To achieve this, we need to recognize three interdependent and necessary groups: **chefs**, **patrons**, and **restaurant owners**.

### Chefs

these are the people who love tools and systems, if you've worked in tech for more than a year you know the type (if not, it's me, I am a stereotypical chef in this metaphor). the important things for a chef to be successful are:

- **the right tools**:

  - ❌**swiss army knife**: there's a dialectical tension between flexibility and focus when it comes to tooling. it's understandably attractive to gravitate towards flexible, highly integrated tools that offer a unified experience across all of a knowledge workers' tasks. tools like Notion appear to offer one user experience covering relational databases, collaborative note-taking, task management, and seemingly limitless other possibilities for data-centric applications. this is because at heart they aren't any of these things, but in fact low-code knowledge application design tools. in practice, for most organizations of more than a dozen people, this proves to be _too much_ flexibility. rather than a unified interface, they degrade into dozens, then hundreds, of separate user experiences. without stringent central control designing the system, the entropy accelerates exponentially with headcount and falls apart. you end up trying to cook a meal for 12 friends with a swiss army knife. if you have a strong "chefs, patrons, restaurant owners" culture in place before implementing, tools like this can be perfect, rather than a swiss army knife you can design your perfect integrated set of tools, but that's often not the case.

  - ❌**fuguhiki**: on the other of the spectrum is the fuguhiki, an exceedingly narrow blade designed _specifically_ for making the precise cuts needed to turn the toxic puffer fish (fugu) into edible sashimi. an example of this would be something like OmmWriter. it's intentionally designed to be a beautiful, minimal, and satisfying writing app. That's it. Every feature it has is aimed at [doing one thing and doing it well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well), and that focus is a feature itself. While these types of tools are often beloved by those who perform the tasks they focus on often, the sheer number of tools to be managed if you're knitting together tools with the specificity of the fuguhiki will lead to the same exponential complexity growth you get from the swiss army knife's blank flexibility.

  - ✅**nikiri**: a thin rectangular japanese knife useful for a broad variety of slicing and chopping tasks. it's easy to control, lightweight, and versatile. it fills a broad but distinct set of needs, and with a prudent selection of 2 or 3 other knives you could cover almost any culinary situation vastly better than with the aforementioned universal multi-tool. at the same time, unlike the cumbersome western chef's knife, our target of a nikiri-like tool in 2022 and beyond will be API forward, and prioritize integrations. by coordinating 3 or 4 focused but versatile apps with strong APIs, and dedicating the resources and authority to those using them to design and cook our menu, we can create an ideal restaurant experience.

- **stay focused on the food**:

- **authority**:

### patrons

these are the people that just want to enjoy the meal: they have campaigns to run, questions to answer, products to build, and team members to review. they may enjoy cooking sometimes, but not enough to make it their profession. they may or may not be able to build systems within a given toolset, but they respect and appreciate the work of a chef regardless. the important things for a patron to have a great meal are:

- **order off the menu**: if you've made the choice to not take on the burden of being a chef, then let the kitchen do its thing. you can always give feedback, but make your decision to be a patron a conscious one, and with it, trust the chefs and stick to the systems they've cooked up. if something is wrong, let them know instead of ordering off-menu — for example, adding chaos by building a separate system within the system.

- **get good food**: you should, as a patron, be getting the knowledge you need, if not, the chefs and restaurant owners need to know.

- **get good service**: you should, as a patron, be able to quickly get the knowledge you need and contribute to the knowledge loop easily within the systems constructed. if not, the chefs and restaurant owners need to make some changes.

- **pay the bill, tip well, and compliment the chef**: this means taking the time to give thorough positive and negative feedback. it's crucially important to build mutual appreciation and gratitude between those who do invest in building the systems and those who decide to focus on using it. without chefs _and_ patrons the meal has no meaning and there is no restaurant!

### restaurant owners

these are the people with the authority to approve and promote systems, processes, and tools. typically this rests with leadership of an organization, team leads, or perhaps a dedicated async knowledge leader or team. they may be accomplished chefs, perhaps the chef of our very restaurant, although that's the exception not the rule. the important things for a restaurant owner to run a successful establishment are:

- **get feedback from patrons**: you need to be in regular and frequent with patrons, both as they enjoy their meals and after they've had a complete experience. the meal — the knowledge generated by our collective systems — is the _heart_ of a tech organization in the same way that a product is the heart of the business, it should be valued equally.

- **trust and empower chefs:** if we value the meal experience we're making together as much as the product, we also need to invest time and resources in ensuring our chefs have the tools, training, and authority to build the systems they need. this is a balance. just as a successful restaurant owner doesn't give a chef a blank check to gear up their kitchen and hire line cooks, but considers the state of the business, nor do they disappear for months without checking in, you don't abdicate leadership

- **eat at your restaurant regularly**:
  - if you don't love it why would anybody else? too often C-suite leadership uses their own methods of note-taking and knowledge sharing. often c-suite leaders may even cling to differing methods from each other, none of which align with the organizational norms at large. in the beginning an organization or team mimics founding leaderships' preferences, this changes as headcount grows, and leadership — our restaurant owners — should change with it.
  - if the authority rests with a specific async or remote team— our chef-owner-operator scenario — this still applies! because they're not doing the day-to-day work of the organization, as patrons are, it's important they're _using_ the systems — eating the meals — to understand the feel of the process. feedback isn't enough, you need to taste the food and experience the service firsthand, regularly.
