ml art and what we value about art and music

now there are drum machines that sound like machines and machines that sound like humans and humans that sound like drum machines and humans that sound like humans.

we eventually settle into creating across all the spectrums and axes of human and machine, because ultimately, what is ML if not an attempt to codify parts of ourselves. we need only be as afraid of AI as we are of ourselves, and that's up to the individual. if you're a fragile and isolated ego against the universe, ML is an annihilating horror. if you're part of a thick and tangled web of consciousness foaming out across the multiverse, it's all just bubbles, baby.
