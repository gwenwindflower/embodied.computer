control is fragile.
centralization and decentralization are not the same spectrum as control and cooperation. cooperative centralization is the essence of analytics engineering, and the centralization is about simplicity. it's the reason you see apps gravitating towards monorepos. the centralization wasn't the problem, it was the control and ensuing conflicts. cooperative centralization is helpful for all. centralization creates a system we can cooperate within. without a foundational system we have to burn resources build a system to cooperate in every time we meet somebody we want to cooperate with. if we can agree to work within a centralized system we can do this once.
