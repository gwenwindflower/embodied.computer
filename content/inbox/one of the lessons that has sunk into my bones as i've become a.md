# the patriarchy of reason
one of the lessons that has sunk into my bones as i've become a woman, is the futility of 'rational debate'. 
- it's about _convincing_, which is a product of emotional pressure, which is about **power**
- it's white patriarchal colonialist capitalism at its core
- what's important is 
	- the courage to constantly dig for truth inside yourself.
	- to take care of yourself that your better nature can flourish.
	- use the flourishing of your better nature to take care of those around you, in a reciporcal cycle.
	- learn from one another and form truth together. attempting to generate 'truth' by exercising emotional pressure over another is a form of violence, which triggers a negative reaction. we cannot make somebody see that we are right. 
	- if the truth we seek to share is real, and we're motivated by the right reasons, living that truth will bring others to it in time. maybe long after our own deaths, but better that than neeedless violence.
		- truth and violence are incompatible. the bedrock of truth is love and oneness, therefore violence could never spread truth.

rationalism is not what humanity is about, there's a reason that the vulcans seem bizarre and inhuman to us. it's a miscalculation of approach, and rationalism always serves at the behest of emotion and desire. it's a tool not a path, and can be wielded as a weapon just as easily at can be utilized to repair and build.

hey pal, i have an awkward favor to ask you. i just had a compound bill (the hospital rolled up several costs and seemingly i need the individual documentation) rejected from my FSA so i have to pay it out of pocket ASAP. i have enough in my nascent savings account (unfortunately it's going to reset me to zero from getting my $10k emergency fund together) plus my checking to cover it. i'm going to dig into the rejection because it's 100% something that should be covered, but in the meantime i have to deal with it so it doesn't go to collections. i get paid on friday but i want to at least have *some* buffer in my account to get me through. would you be okay with loaning me just like $500 so i'm not riding the edge this week, i can pay you back on friday when i get paid.

i'm starting to think, as embarrassing as it is, that long term i might actually start a gofundme or something to help me deal with the combination of medical debt and incoming transition costs because so little is covered.
