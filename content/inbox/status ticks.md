Do people bounce off data and statistics because of trauma and attachment style?

If you assume the worst will happen, that the game is rigged, then what good is making educated guesses?

If all roads lead to a bad place, why expend the mental resources to calculate the best decision? Why expend the emotional resources to consider the worst outcomes?

If you expect something bad to happen, then it's rational to just approach a problem with what feels good now.

The practice of good data science requires hope, safety, community, faith, and security â€” qualities rarely discussed in the data space, and if they are, often maligned. This is because people privileged to experience these things as given, that is, straight cis financially secure neurotypical white men with non-abusive childhoods, taken them for granted. Fish in water if you will.

If you've always had a baseline sense that everything will be okay, it can be hard to envision what it's like to never have that. That's not the fault of people with robust mental health and healthy attachment styles, but if they want the results of data science to be more impactful, if they want statistics to be more universally compelling, they should direct more effort towards trying to understand that experience that underlines the bulk of human experience, and bring that understanding into their work.
