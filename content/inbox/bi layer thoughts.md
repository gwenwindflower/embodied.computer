The BI layer bums me out, and I'm not alone.

I'm thankful for how bad the BI layer is, really. It's the thing that drove me to learn SQL. SQL lead me to dbt and the craft of constructing conduits of meaning through which data can flow and produce, ideally, narratives that are meaningful to human beings. The craft we call analytics engineering.

Analytics engineering, like a teenager picking up the Tao Te Ching after a steady diet of Salinger and Tolkien, seeks to bring settled wisdom into the wild, adolescent world of the 'modern data stack'. In practical terms, the virtues of software engineering. No more dreaming of daring final quests or reveling in frustrated angst. Simplicity! Balance! Clarity! Fidelity! Longevity! These are the things we pursue with a steadfast heart.

Throughout much of the ELT(or EtLTEtL) 'stack' (which, as data flows become ever more circular *and* divergent, feels increasingly like a misnomer and an example of a term we should *not* borrow from software, but that's for another issue), this mindset has gained rapid ground over the past few years. Unfortunately, the final layer, BI, lags behind for several reasons.

Rant about self-serve ruining BI. Rant about self-serve and metrics. About current approaches and proposals.

How might we capture the logic in code, without being bound to a specific tool, with what we have available today. I propose one possible approach in this video.
