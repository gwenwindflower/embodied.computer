# strengths are weaknesses
i feel pretty strongly that all qualities are a [double edged sword](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/double-edged-sword/). in the right situation Quality A saves the day. in a different context Quality A gets you killed. or perhaps just into a fight with a waiter. who knows - Quality A is powerful and mysterious.

i think you see this as a foundational understanding in taoism, but it's the kind of nuance that's hard to find in Western Thought.

an example: bobby thinks 'i am a strong leader'. in western culture we teach people that is an unalloyed Good Thing. that in fact, in an obvious paradox, all people should strive to be great leaders (particularly men). so you get many people self assigning this label mistakenly (this is one very bad outcome of a viewpoint that sees qualities as inherently good or bad). but let's assume, for the sake of this example, bobby _is_, in fact, a Good Leader. that probably maps to a bundle of qualities like:
- makes decisions quickly
- confident in decisions made quickly and following through on them
- doesn't get rattled too easily
- able to exert will over a group via presence, charisma, threats, extroversion, all kinds of things that operate in combination and that weird men's rights armchair psychiatrists think about _waaaay_ too much

let's now consider the downside of all these:
- ~makes decisions quickly~ hasty decisions that miss long term nth order effects
- ~confident in decisions made quickly and following through on them~ stays on the wrong course too long, ignores signals to pivot or adjust
- ~doesn't get rattled too easily~ lacking sensitivity to detect subtle and useful inputs
- ~able to exert will over a group~ history has kinda taken care of the downsides of this one for me

what's important here is that both of these lists are the *same qualities* in action, it's only the context that's changed. the same quality that got us a good outcome in List A gets us a bad outcome in List B because of its relationship to its surrounding context. this is how we work. we have tendencies, we act on them, and we evaluate whether they're good or bad based on the consequences. most of the time we don't even know what we hope will happen, we're just doin things we're told we're supposed to do or wanting things we're told we're supposed to want. so if we're hoping to rid ourselves of our 'bad qualities' and maximize our 'good' - it would behoove us to take a step back and get clear on what our context is and what we hope to happen #7. from there we can understand how our qualities and tendencies may interact with the context and strategize on how to leverage them to get where we want to go.

in summary: 

➕ the things you like about yourself? don't! they're just as likely to get you into trouble as the things you hate, and liking only some parts of you feeds disliking others. instead focus on loving that whole messy quilt of unique ideas and experiences that is you _unconditionally_, bb. 

➖ the things you hate about yourself? chill! meditate on contexts in which they could be strengths, or the unexpectedly good pathways your mistakes have led you down. let the negative charge ⚡ drain from them and take that energy, transmuted into an unconditional self-love, and put it on that quilt i mentioned (you, you are the quilt). 

(is this a double edged sword even? i do not know. kinda seems like no. kinda seems like it may not be sharp at all. saw a description while i was grabbing this link that called it a gun so i really don't know what's going on at this point. anyway, it was the first Famous Sword that came to mind)
