I want to create a socialist, anarchist society that displaces capitalism through peaceful flourishing, without widespread hardship or violence.

I believe if better, localized alternatives are lived out, they can gain momentum and peacefully displace capitalism.

There was a time when overcoming monarchy seemed beyond imagining, I think it's necessary to remember that capitalism to can be displaced.
