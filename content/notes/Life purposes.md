#collection 

A collection of things that drive me:
- My [[bodhisattva seed]]: "To nurture love and joy in all beings I cross paths with."
- [[Make computing more artistic and delightful]].
- [[Create a culture of kindness and mutual cooperation]] that displaces capitalism through peaceful flourishing, without widespread hardship.
