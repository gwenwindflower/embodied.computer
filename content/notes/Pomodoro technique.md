title: "Pomodoro technique"
---

I'm a huge proponent of the pomodoro technique. I use the tool [Focus](https://heyfocus.com/) for Mac to simultaneously block distractions and keep track of my poms. I like this one for several reasons, but most uniquely, because it's highly scriptable. I have a script written in Raycast that lets me easily launch pomodoro sessions and update my status in Slack in a keyboard-driven way.
