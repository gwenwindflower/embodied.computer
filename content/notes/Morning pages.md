title: "Morning pages"
---

I write at least 500 words every morning on a variety of topics. Typically selecting my topic is the process of one [[notes/Pomodoro technique|pomodoro]] and writing is a second one. The process takes ~1 hour.

At present I write using the app [Pagi](https://futureland.tv/@lucas/pagi) which is designed specifically for a distraction-free and attracitve morning pages practice. I track the habit in the maker of Pagi's other app [Futureland](https://futureland.tv/).
