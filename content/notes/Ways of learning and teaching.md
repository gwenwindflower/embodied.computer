#collection 
This is a collection of my current thoughts on learning and teaching.

- [[notes/Teaching and learning are the same process]]
- [[notes/Note-taking is an art practice]]
- [[notes/Writing is one of the best ways to learn]]
- [[notes/Split skills into smaller chunks and work to achieve expertise quickly]]
- [[notes/Hundreds of examples beats thousands of words]]
