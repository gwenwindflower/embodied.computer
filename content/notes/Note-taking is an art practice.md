title: "Note-taking is an art practice"
---
Creating and sharing notes is an art pratice. Like painting or writing music, it requires creativity, discipline, skill, and experimentation. Digital tools, much like with art or music, enable more people to craft a practice, and in more elaborate ways.

Again, like other arts, digital tools like Obsidian (in which these notes were written) enable much wider distribution and cross-pollination between works. People can and do remix and build on each others ideas to create their own works.

[[notes/Writing is one of the best ways to learn]], but beyond that they communicate a being's experience of life, emotion, and learning. The individual notes, and their overarching structure provides layers of meaning, expression, and interpretation.

Appreciating note-taking for both it's utility and its artistic qualities leads to a more satisfying and interesting experience of the craft.
