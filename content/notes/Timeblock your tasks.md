As somebody with ADHD, anxiety, and compulsive perfectionism, tasks can easily expand to fill an unlimited amount of time.

A well arranged todo list is only marginally helpful. What works much better for me is adding time spans to each task, which are visualized by [NotePlan](https://noteplan.co/) as timeblocks integrated with my calendar.

This lets me not only get more done, but see realistically what I can achieve in a day. When I can see what I can get done more accurately in a day, I can do that for a week, and this ripples up larger time dimensions.

Within timeblocks I use [[notes/Pomodoro technique|pomodoros]].
