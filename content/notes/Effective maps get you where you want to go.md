You can't measure the effectiveness of a map based on its resolution or how well it was constructed. These are useful things to know, but the effectiveness of maps is measured based on it getting you where you want to go.

This idea is expanded on in my blog article ["Intention deficit"](https://gwenwindflower.com/blog/1)
