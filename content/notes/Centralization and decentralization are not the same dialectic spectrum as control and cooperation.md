title: Centralization and decentralization are not the same dialectic spectrum as control and cooperation
---

This is quite often confused

People tend to think that [[notes/Structure is layers of process|structure and process are bad, when what they're really chafing at is _control_, _hierarchy_ (layers of control)]]. 

Centralization and process can be hugely freeing, they create the conditions for clarity. [[Clarity is an equalizing force]]. Typically existing power structures and hierarchies are the ones that benefit for lack of clarity. If nobody knows what's going on or how decisions are made, those who already have power can continue operating as they wish. Thus it's no surprise that many of the biggest tech CEOs decry process as a innovation-killing and pace-slowing. If you have power, why would you want to introduce means by which it could be checked? Why would you want to transfer more power to the collective and away from yourself and those you choose? You wouldn't.


## Why do we have these associations between centralization and control?

Well, because it's undeniable that one often generates the other. 

Centralization creates conditions where humans tend to be exploited by a dominant personality exerting control.

Decentralization has been offered as a political philosophy, via anarchism, for centuries, but recent technology has brought the idea into new realms and common parlance.

The thing is decentralization moves us away from centralization, which may or may not move us away from control. Decentralized systems are difficult to control, but not impossible, and while through the added difficulty they often break up control, they similarly are difficult to _cooperate_ within.

This is the most important measure of any human systems: the ability of human beings to cooperate within it.

When we get rid of centralization, we often dismantle our coooperative connections. We need to be attacking _control_ not centralization. Centralized systems of cooperation are generally very beneficial for all involved. An example most tech workers can empathize with is the difficult in finding anything in Notion when teams splinter in 10s, 100s, or 1000s of separate databases. Lacking clear centralized processes actually _increases_ the leverage individuals have by providing a wider platform for their work, and enhanced opportunities for cooperation.

## Analytics engineering is cooperative centralization

Analytics engineering is designed as a system of cooperative centralization. A collaborative knowledge graph in which the entire company works through sense-making activities to find meaning together. The warehouse need not be physically centralized, nor does a single repository of code need to represent an analytics engineering project, but there should be an emphasis on *meaning* remaining cooperative, and a light pressure towards effective centralization will lend itself to that, versus an opposite push to decentralize as much as possible. A single source of truth is always the goal of analytics engineering, even if that source is a variety of projects and tools. It's up to those who build dbt to create the cooperative, centralized experience of a single source of truth across disparate, heterogenous tools and platforms.
