title: "Write to learn"
---

Writing is akin to teaching, in that forces you to shine a bright light on the areas you have illusory understanding of. It quickly reveals where you're shaky on a topic, and seems to solidify the knowledge you write down in your brain, via forcing you to recall it and create new thought with it.

I operate from a policy that if I haven't written notes on something, I don't really know it.
