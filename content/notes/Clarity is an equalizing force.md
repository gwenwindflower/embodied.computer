title: "Clarity is an equalizing force"

The people who benefit from lack of clarity are those already in power. [[Implicit structures, processes, and powers always exist]], it's just a matter of if they've been made _explicit_ through clarity or not.

If they've been made clear, people then have a canvas to change them.
